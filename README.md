# graduation-design
this article is based on actual tourism scenarios and develops a mobile landscape tourism text automatic generation system in the form of a website that can calculate spatial relationships within a certain range of users, convert the calculation results into text, and provide voice description services. This system uses the Django framework as the backend for development, implements basic map services using Baidu Maps JavaScript API GL, and completes all the functions of the system design using Python. After testing, the website can run stably and meet the design requirements and implementation goals.
